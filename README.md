# Car Finder

Responsive <b>Angular SPA</b> application. This is the development branch for <b>Car Finder</b> application deployed in Heroku
from <b>offers-jwt-ngrx-herocu</b> branch.
The existence of a separate branch for deployment is necessary because of the <b>PostgreSQL</b> database that is used in Heroku.
Using of PostgreSQL requires small changes in the database requests.
